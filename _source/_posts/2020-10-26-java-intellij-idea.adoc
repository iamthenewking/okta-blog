If you're a Java developer like me, you like to get shit done. I like a lot of things about IntelliJ IDEA, but I find the following ones make me most productive.

Disclaimer: as a Java Champion, I get a free license to IntelliJ. If I didn't my company would gladly pay for it.

== Run Your Java Apps from IntelliJ IDEA

Show how to run Spring Boot, Micronaut, and Quarkus from IntelliJ.

When I was a junior Java developer, I always wanted to use Ant or Maven to avoid vendor lock-in. In fact, I switched to IntelliJ in 2006 when I was migrating AppFuse from Ant to Maven. The Maven support for multiple modules was so much better than Eclipse's m2e, I switched.

== Debug Your Java Apps

Local and remote debugging.

TIP: Include link or section on debugging JavaScript apps.

== My Favorite Keyboard Shortcuts in IntelliJ IDEA

== Markdown and AsciiDoc support

Plugins: https://intellij-asciidoc-plugin.ahus1.de/[IntelliJ AsciiDoc Plugin]

Markdown support is bundled.

== Live Templates

An awesome way to pre-record code snippets for demos and increased productivity. Give Java example.

== Web Framework Support

Why? I'm a full-stack developer, and I love JHipster.

- Angular, React, and Vue
- HTML, CSS, and Sass support is excellent

Lots of React plugins, but I haven't tried any.

https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9442-vue-js[Vue.js plugin] is from JetBrains.

Angular is bundled.
